Porter-Duff Browser is a sample Android application that displays the
effect of the various options available for an
android.graphics.PorterDuffXfermode. The display shows the source and
destination sample images (simple colour-alpha ramps), and underneath
that a scrolling list of the effects of the different modes on those
images.
